Scratch Notes
=============

## Todo list

* Need to determine what the general layout should be.  Maybe some sort of portal type setup where the blog and similar services are separated

* Need to port over current santiagodevelopment blog.  Port over all posts to markdown?

* move picasa photo api over to a seperate service

* Make everything compliant with [the web dev checklist](http://webdevchecklist.com/)

* HTML5 all over the place

* figure out the mvc 4 changes and incorporate some better view management than santiavodevelopment had

* Source control for posts and other content would be nice
