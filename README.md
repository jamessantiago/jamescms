========

A pretty simple blog type site.  Built with MVC 4 and a litany of open source components such as:

 - DotNetOpenAuth
 - Entity Framework
 - Fleck
 - Google.GData
 - Growl
 - jQuery
 - MarkDownDeep
 - LibGit2Sharp
 - HTML5 Boilerplate
 - NLog
 - Prettify

Maybe some of the things I built could be usefult to you.  So... here it is.
